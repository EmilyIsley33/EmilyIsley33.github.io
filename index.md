# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4- Conversion Units and High/low game

	This lab was one of my favorites because it was straight to the point. Back then when we first started this class I was nervous and did not know much about programming but completing these two programs was really fun and helped me learn alot. The unit conversion program was fun for me because I got to calculate things and figure out how to write out the code. Also, the hilo program was a fun easy game I could show and play with my parents. 

Lab 6- Madlib and Blackjack

	I like lab 6 because I found what we were creating to be very interesting to me, as I am a fan of card games and madlibs. The lab was one of the easier ones for me and I was able to write the code with my partner very smoothly with minimal errors in our lines of code. When we wrote this program I was so fascinated  that I could make the terminal ask me what to put in the blanks so I’m very proud of myself for completing this lab.

Lab 9- Spell Checker and Guessing the Secret Number Game

	Lab 9 gets a little more challenging but I like the new concepts I learned to do in this lab. Specifically pulling in and out information in files, where we scanned a document file for missed spelled words and stored the secret number in a different file to hide the number from the other player. I chose this lab particularly because it shows that I have learned more from taking this course, since we made the secret number game before but very basic and not as fun.
